    <p>The world-famous Paradise brand has its origins in a small Canteen and a Café in a cinema theatre called Paradise in Secunderabad in the Year 1953.<br><br>

    A small 100-seater restaurant started serving typical Hyderabadi cuisine like Biryani etc. from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food items to the people as a one-stop Food Store.<br><br>

    In 1978, Mr A Hemati took complete charge of the Restaurant from his Father & Uncle and set about renovating the Restaurant to suit the changing social trends and the evolving food habits of people in India.<br><br>

    In 1983 an Air-cooled multi-cuisine Restaurant called Paradise Persis Family Restaurant and the highly popular Paradise Takeaway came up at Secunderabad.<br><br>

    In 1987 the Paradise theatre and consequently the Canteen was closed. But the Café and Restaurant continued its operations.<br><br>

    In 1996, Paradise underwent a major restructuring, renovation and modernization programme. It expanded both vertically and horizontally.<br><br>

    In 2006, the entire operations were computerised & technology upgradations have been continuously happening since then.<br><br>

    In 2016, a Management team comprising experienced professionals were appointed to execute the aggressive growth plan.<br><br>

    Paradise expanded its operations by moving into Bengaluru, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Gurugram besides expanding its presence in Hyderabad. More outlets are being planned in the above cities and an aggressive nationwide expansion plan including a foray into international markets is also underway.<br><br>
